# Tic Tac Toe

This is my implementation of the famous game.

I used only Python in this project.

The game is played by using the numbers 1 - 9 to mark the positions of the board.
Whoever player has 3 continuous marks in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.
If all the locations are marked, but no one has won, then it's a tie!
