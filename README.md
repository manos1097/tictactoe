# Tic Tac Toe

This is my implementation of the famous game.

I used only Python in this project.

The game is played by using the numbers 1 - 9 to mark the positions of the board.
Whoever player has 3 continuous marks in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.
If all the locations are marked, but no one has won, then it's a tie!

# How to execute script

Scenario 1: If you have already installed python 3 and added to the PATH variable

1. Download tic.py file
2. Open Command Prompt or Terminal inside the folder that contains the downloaded file
3. Execute the command: python tic.py

Scenario 2: If not. The easiest way is by using the Anaconda installer

2. Click "Download"
3. Under the "Python 3.7 version" title click on the link of the Graphical Installer that is proper for your system
4. Install the downloaded installer package and make sure that you check the checkbox that says "Add to the PATH variable"
